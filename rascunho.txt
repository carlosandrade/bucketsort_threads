10 elements 
6 slave process
10/6 = 1 array position to every slave = max data collected of 6 positions = WRONG
increase array position for every slave by 1 

2*6 = 12 'ok' all slaves will look for more than exist, in this specific case one slave will have nothing to do 

basically slaves must be aware of how many positions they must deal with as they may vary 
this is already done since when a process slave receives a message, it updates a global variable that tells how many positions 
on the original data he needs to work on

basically all that needs to be fixed is letting an array knows when he shouldnt do anything (0 situation) OR 
modify the master sender decision so that it gives at least 1 position for each slave , still this may not occur in case
there is less data than slaves

according to the assignment ths doesnt works, since there is 50 to 150 tasks, and 5 to 10 process, which means  there is always
more tasks than data
